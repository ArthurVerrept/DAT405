# Javascript Project 1
This project can be found at: https://arthurverrept.github.io/index1.html

Playing with p5.js to create randomly generated patterns and learning javascript basics, the project created was focusing on generative coding, using randomness to create a final product.

The project uses a noise function to map a line across the screen and then a set of ellipses interact with that line as it moves. The user can add new ellipses and create patterns that way, that can also control the gravity and distance from the line they wish to have the ellipses bounce.

This project taught me the basics of javascript, and really helped me translate my coding skills from C# to JS.
